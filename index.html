	<h2> Why is marine pollution an important issue?</h2>
	<P> Oceans are the largest water bodies on the planet Earth. Over the last few decades, excessive human activities have
		severely affected marine life on the Earth’s oceans. Ocean pollution, also known as marine pollution, is the spreading
		of harmful substances such as oil, plastic, industrial and agricultural waste and chemical particles into the ocean. Since
		oceans provide the home to a wide variety of marine animals and plants, it is the responsibility of every citizen to play
		his or her part in making these oceans clean so that marine species can thrive for a longer period of time.
	</P>
  <h2> How does marine pollution affect us?</h2>
  <p>The ocean plays an essential role for life on earth. It provides over 70 percent  of the oxygen we breathe and over 97 percent of the world’s water supply. Everyday, the ocean is under attack from natural sources and manmade pollution. Pollution does not only affect marine life and their environment, it also affects mankind.

Every day, toxic chemicals are entering our oceans. These toxic chemicals have either been dumped on purpose from industrial sources or naturally flow off land and directly into our rivers and streams, which eventually end up in our oceans.  

Chemicals such as oil, mercury, lead, pesticides, and other heavy metals can all be found within the ocean and can contaminate water supplies and our food chain by affecting the marine life involved. If humans are exposed to these toxic chemicals for long periods of time, then this can result in dangerous health problems, which include hormonal issues, reproductive issues, and damage to our nervous systems and kidneys.
